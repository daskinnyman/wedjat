## Tech Stack

### Apps

- **server**: Backend service using Hono framework, Prisma ORM, and TypeScript
- **extension**: Chrome browser extension using crxjs and TypeScript

### Packages

- **shared**: Shared code and utility libraries

## Development Environment Setup

1. Ensure pnpm is installed
2. Run `pnpm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies
3. All sub-projects will automatically establish links

## Workspace Configuration

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

## Sub-project Development

Each sub-project has its own `package.json` file and can independently manage dependencies and scripts. pnpm automatically handles dependency linking within the workspace.
